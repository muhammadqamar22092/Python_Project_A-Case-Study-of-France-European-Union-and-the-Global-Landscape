# Python_Project_A-Case-Study-of-France-European-Union-and-the-Global-Landscape
#A long term comparison of the economic, demographic, and environmental indicators of France with respect to the EU and the world over half a century. We use 25 charts to demonstrate how GDP growth is tied to the population, the trend in trade, and alterations in nature. France and the EU recorded an increasing trend in GDP indicating strong expansion of the economy. Nevertheless, fluctuations in the GDP growth rates, especially during a major downfall, reflect weak economic policies. The population growth in France and the EU was decreasing while the rest of the world continued to increase. These rising age dependency ratios pose challenges for the future labor markets, health-care, as well as pension schemes. Environmental analysis focused on huge progress towards lowering greenhouse gas emissions per capita and raising renewables' usage in France and renewable in line with worldwide climate change aims. These findings give a complex picture of the interrelations existing between these factors and hence show some implications which can be considered for next policymaking, economic management as well as environmental arrangements.
